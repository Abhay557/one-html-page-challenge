        <h1>Movie List</h1>
        <p>
            This is a list of movies watched by Christopher Powroznik. Hopefully the goal one day is to include all movies
            watched. For sake of understanding, when rating the list, I consider 5 as the average movie, so trying to make
            things somewhat bell-curved. Also, I do not rate movies giving context for their timeframe, so no bonus points
            for being culturally significant or being old. I initially made the list from the top 250 on IMDB, but will
            expand upon over time.
